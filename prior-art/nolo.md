## Legal Information Is Not Legal Advice

This website (the "Website") is a service made available by Internet Brands, Inc., its partners, affiliates or subsidiaries ("Provider").  This Website provides general information related to the law and lawyers designed to help users safely cope with their own legal needs. This website does not provide legal advice and Provider is not a law firm.  None of our customer service representatives are lawyers and they also do not provide legal advice. Although we go to great lengths to make sure our information is accurate and useful, we recommend you consult a lawyer if you want legal advice. No attorney-client or confidential relationship exists or will be formed between you and Provider or any of our representatives.

If you are using the Lawyer Services you should read the following terms and conditions below. If you disagree with these terms and services, please do not use the Lawyer Services.
