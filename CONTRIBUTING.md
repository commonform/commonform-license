Contributing to the Common Form License
=======================================

Thanks for your interest in the [Common Form License](https://github.com/commonform/license)!

The Common Form License is under active development toward a first public release. If you'd like to contribute to creating a trustworthy, lawyer- and user-friendly permissive license for legal documents, please consider collaborating via [GitHub](https://github.com). You can [register for a free GitHub account online](https://github.com/join) and browse the current state and history of Common Form License development at [the project's page](https://github.com/commonform/license).

If you'd like to pose a question or make a general proposal, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/commonform/license/issues/new). Issues work much like a public Internet message board, though they're better integrated with the tools used to track revisions to the text of the license.

If you would like to propose specific changes to the license's language, please edit the [Common Form License.md](./Common Form License.md) file. ([GitHub's help pages guide you through the process](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/).) In GitHub lingo, this will "fork", or create a copy of, the Common Form License project, and then start a "Pull Request" asking to make your changes part of the original Common Form License project. If "forks", "branches", and [the Git revision control system](http://git-scm.com) are old hat for you, create a topic branch from `master` however your please and PR back, [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) style. [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) and [gitattributes](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes) should keep things in order.
